# Hyper Ultra Astronautics Mobile Controller

[Hyper Ultra Astronautics](http://www.fractilegames.com/astronautics/) is an intense local multiplayer space arena shooter with co-op and competitive game modes for up to 16 players. The actual game runs on a Windows or Linux PC. This mobile application connects to the game running in same Wi-Fi network and lets you join the match.

This is a [Godot engine](https://godotengine.org/) 3.1.2 project (there is a branch for older godot 2.x version too). The official Android version is on [GooglePlay](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.fractilegames.astronautics).

Notes:

- The exported application will need "internet" and "vibrate" permissions set.
- This is definitely not a good example of proper code structuring (everything hacked together in one big scene/script).
